Pizza Restaurant API

This is a RESTful API built with Flask that simulates a simple pizza restaurant backend system. It allows users to view restaurants and pizzas, and to associate pizzas with restaurants through a join model `RestaurantPizza`. This project uses the MVC architecture and SQLAlchemy ORM with a SQLite or PostgreSQL database.
